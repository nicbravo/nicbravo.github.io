**Nic Bravo** is an identity of convenience I use for certain roles online. I keep my public profile pretty bare intentionally. You may know me by another name--keep it to yourself.

Currently:
* Producer/editor at [Stay Mean](https://staymean.co), the world's only podcast network.
* Available to help marginalized folks who have questions about getting started podcasting or working with audio.
	* Especially: trans women, gay people, BIPOC folks
	* But if you've got more money than me you should pay me
